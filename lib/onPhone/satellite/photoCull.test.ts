/**
 * photoCullPlan — the direction2.6 viewport cull, locked by numbers.
 *
 * Before the cull, the page mounted every baked photo on disk and never
 * unmounted: RAM grew with the PIN COUNT, not the screen (Law 5). These tests
 * pin the two-ring geometry that replaced it — mount one viewport out, unmount
 * two out (hysteresis) — and the two laws the cull must NOT break: Law 1 (a
 * photo on screen is mounted at EVERY zoom — the plan sees geometry, never a
 * zoom level) and Law 3 (the pre-mount ring means a panning user never sees a
 * photo pop in; the hysteresis band means one never flaps on the edge).
