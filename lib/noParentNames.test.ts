/**
 * A CHILD MAY NOT SAY THE NAME OF A PARENT.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE ESCAPE CHECK
 * The build-time plugin in each parent asks "did this path leave the
 * workspace?" That misses the likeliest mistake by far: everything is checked
 * out side by side, so `../ReTreever/src/lib/foo` RESOLVES. It is inside the
 * workspace, it opens, the page renders — and it is meaningless the moment
 * this folder is published as its own repo, where no sibling named ReTreever
 * exists.
 *
 * So the rule here is about NAMES, not geometry. A child that writes the word
 * `ReTreever`, `rapper`, or `vercel` has hardcoded an assumption about who its
 * parent is. A child has TWO possible parents and must work under either, so
 * naming one is the defect regardless of whether the path currently resolves.
 *
 * WHY A TEST AND NOT A PLUGIN
 * A child ships no vite.config.ts — it is not an app, it is a folder a parent
 * builds. There is no build here to hook a plugin into. vitest needs no app,
 * so this runs in a bare clone of this folder alone: `npm test`. That is the
 * only enforcement an outside contributor can actually execute, which is
 * precisely the person this is for.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED
 * The alias. `$parent/siblings/...` names no parent — it is a seam each parent fills
 * in for itself, which is the whole mechanism. And this child's OWN name may
 * contain "ReTreever" (ReTreever_who_what), so a bare match on the word is
 * wrong; what is banned is naming a parent as a LOCATION.

 * it here, no parent ever bundles it — so it is on the guard's own side of the
 * line. Better than that: the contract and lockstep tests EXIST to look at the
 * parents (`lib/contract/oneComponent.test.ts` joins "ReTreever" and "rapper"
 * on purpose; `grid.lockstep.test.ts` reads ReTreever's Worker grid) and skip
 * when a parent is absent. Eight such lines went red on 28 Aug 2026 and every
 * one was a test doing its job.

 * loud and red in a bare clone — the opposite of the silent "it resolves, the

/**
 * THE TRAILING DELIMITER USED TO BE `[/.]`, AND THAT WAS THE HOLE.
 *
 * Requiring a `/` or `.` AFTER the name only matches a parent in the MIDDLE of
 * a path — `../ReTreever/src/...`. A parent at the END of a string sailed
 * straight through, so all of these passed a green guard:
 *
 *     href="{GH}/rapper"
 *     "https://github.com/Ground-Truth-Data/rapper"
 *     <span>retreever</span>
 *
 * The GitHub link and the visible tier labels in routes/+layout.svelte are the
 * most flagrant parent-naming in this repo and the guard reported zero.
 *
 * WHY IT SURVIVED: the self-test below proved exactly one shape — the same
 * mid-path shape the regex was written from — so the blind spot could not be
 * caught by the thing meant to catch it. A check that only tests the case it
 * was designed for is a check that tests nothing. It now asserts a TERMINAL
 * name too, which is the case that was missing.
 *
 * So the name may now be followed by a path separator, a string/JSX terminator,
 * whitespace, or the end of the line.
 *
 * The LEADING side needed widening for the same reason. `href="{GH}/rapper"`
 * puts a template-interpolation close — `}` — immediately before the slash, so
 * a prefix list of only `../`, a quote or `(` did not match it either. Both
 * ends of the pattern were written from path examples; a link built by
 * interpolation is neither a path nor a bare literal, and it was the actual
 * offender sitting in this repo.
