/**
 * WHAT THE PACK SHIPS — the one list of source-layers (and the feature kinds
 * inside each) that a blob tile carries. Worker and phone both read THIS file.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *   roads (all) · water (lakes + rivers) · places (city…hamlet) · pois (hospital, camp_site)
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⛔ WHY THIS IS A CONTRACT, NOT A WORKER CONSTANT. The keep-set used to live
 * only in `workers/worker-local-dev/src/packBuilder.ts`, and the phone's debug report answered
 * "does the pack hold this layer?" with `t.key === "vector"` — a hard-coded
 * "roads only" that could never learn otherwise. MEASURED 28 Aug 2026 on a
 * live pack: ONE source layer, `roads`, so Labels / Places / Hospitals all
 * reported `arrived:false` and nobody could tell a Worker gap from a phone
 * bug. Now the Worker filters BY this table and the report reads FROM it, so
 * the two cannot disagree — the same "one source, re-exported" rule as
 * `grid.ts` and `blob.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ATTRIBUTE KEY MATTERS. Protomaps v4 tags every `places` feature
 * `kind: "locality"` and puts city/town/village/hamlet in `kind_detail`. The
 * old allowlist matched `kind` against "city" — MEASURED across the 324 z13
 * tiles of one disc: 214 places features, ALL `kind:locality`, so every one
 * was dropped and the layer shipped as a husk (then dropped as empty). The
 * phone's town-label filter made the identical mistake, so even a pack that
 * carried places would have drawn none. Each rule names its key.
 *
 * ── MEASURED (raw z13 feature bytes, one 30 km disc, lat 43.4, 28 Aug 2026) ──
 *     roads        444,675 B  2,394 feats   (everything — the whole pack today)
 *     water         66,858 B  polygons kind=water + 574 B lake
 *     river/canal   16,973 B  170 line feats
 *     stream        50,041 B  295 line feats   ← DROPPED: a third of the water
 *                                                 bytes for creeks sub-pixel at
 *                                                 any zoom the disc is drawn at
 *     places         7,159 B  214 pts (179 hamlets)
 *     pois             174 B  3 hospitals + 4 camp sites
 * Shipping the rows kept below adds ~92 kB raw to a 445 kB roads-only pack.
