/**
 * debugReport.ts — ONE snapshot of everything worth knowing about the offline
 * map, as plain JSON. A screenshot plus one of these should be a smoking gun.
 *
 * ⛔ WHY GEOMETRY, NOT JUST BYTES
 *
 * OFFLINE_PLAN.md engineering rule 4: "Every offline bug this project has had was
 * the same shape: correct bytes in the wrong box. Feature counts and byte
 * totals all looked healthy throughout." So a report that says `64 KB · 3,286
 * features` is worthless on its own — that is exactly what the 45 km, 27.9 km
 * and 50 km bugs each printed while broken. The fields that FOUND those bugs
 * are the blob's CORNERS, its REACH in km, and its OFFSET from the pin, and
 * those are mandatory here.
 *
 * ⛔ ONE AREA AT A TIME — never a viewport query.
 *
 * Same rule: "Make sure it can never report another pin's data as this pin's —
 * the equivalent check in the previous attempt queried the whole viewport, so a
 * neighbouring pin's roads made it report success." Every BlobGeometryReport
 * below is built from ONE CoverageRecord and its own areaKey. There is no
 * bounds query anywhere in this file, and there must never be one.
 *
 * ⛔ NO APP IMPORTS. THIS FILE IS THE PORTABLE UNIT.
 *
 * Rule 5: "The offline map must not import app UI components, stores, or
 * utilities. Give it a narrow, explicit interface — it needs a list of
 * {lng, lat} and nothing else." So pins arrive as a PARAMETER; this module
 * never reaches for mapStore or TinyBase. debugReport.portability.test.ts
 * fails the build if that ever changes — which is what keeps this liftable
 * into rapper without archaeology.
