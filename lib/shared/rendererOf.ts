// Two renderers are live and are not interchangeable at runtime: /mobile/map uses Mapbox GL JS, /mobile/offlinev4 uses MapLibre GL JS (see wallProtocol.ts).
// Wrong library's Marker/Popup on a map doesn't fail politely — it throws "TypeError: e2._addMarker is not a function" from inside addTo (Mapbox-only private method); observed as a BLACK map with no blue dot.
// Worse, if it doesn't throw: a Popup from the wrong library gets the other namespace's DOM classes, so close-button wiring and CSS silently no-op.
// Sniffs the live instance rather than a passed "library" flag — a flag can be forgotten at a call site and reintroduce the wrong-library bug; the instance can't lie.
// Prefer an explicit injection point where one exists (fireLayer's popupLib) — this file is only for helpers with no such seam.
