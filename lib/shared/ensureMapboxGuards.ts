// Memoized, lazy installer for the Mapbox NaN prototype guards.
// ⚠️ must be installed before the first `new mapboxgl.Map(...)` — dt-web awaits ensureMapboxGuards() first; hooks.client.ts also fires it (fire-and-forget) at boot for mobile/native screens.
// ⚠️ don't install synchronously at boot again — that forced the whole ~1.8MB mapbox-gl bundle into every route, map-less pages included.
// Guards are idempotent (Symbol.for-gated), so calling this from several map sites in one session is safe.
